//searchbar element

//still need the import react element because of the JSX
import React from 'react';

//this is a functional component because it has a function. one function - info goes in, JSX comes out
// const SearchBar = () => {
//   return <input />;
// };

//class component is used when the component needs some type of internal record keeping - more aware of itself, ability to say that "something changed about me"
class SearchBar {
  
}

//allows SearchBar to be accessed by other components
export default SearchBar;
